## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **🔐 How secure is my medical data?**
Your medical data is encrypted with AES-256 and stored in a decentralized manner. Access requires explicit consent via NFT tokens, and all activities are logged on the Hedera blockchain for complete transparency and audit trails.

### **🤖 How does the AI work without seeing my data?**
We use federated learning and zero-knowledge proofs. AI models are trained on encrypted data patterns without ever accessing raw medical information, ensuring complete privacy while enabling valuable insights.

### **⚡ Why Hedera instead of other blockchains?**
Hedera offers enterprise-grade security, 10,000+ TPS throughput, 3-5 second finality, and carbon-negative operations - perfect for healthcare applications requiring high performance and regulatory compliance.

### **🔄 Can I export my data?**
Yes! You have complete data portability. Export your health records in standard formats (HL7 FHIR, JSON, PDF) at any time. Your data belongs to you, not the platform.

### **🚨 What happens in emergencies?**
Emergency access protocols allow healthcare providers to access critical information instantly when lives are at stake, with full audit logging and patient notification once the emergency is resolved.

### **💰 How much does it cost to use MediLedger Nexus?**
- **Testnet**: Completely free for development and testing
- **Mainnet**: Only pay for Hedera network fees (fractions of a cent per transaction)
- **No subscription fees** or hidden costs - you only pay for actual blockchain usage

### **🏥 Can my doctor or hospital use this system?**
Absolutely! MediLedger Nexus is designed for seamless integration with existing healthcare systems. We support HL7 FHIR standards and can integrate with major Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.

### **📱 Is there a mobile app?**
Currently, MediLedger Nexus is web-based and works on all devices. Mobile apps for iOS and Android are planned for Phase 2 of our roadmap, expected in Q2 2024.

### **🌍 Which countries is this available in?**
The platform is globally accessible, but healthcare regulations vary by country. We ensure compliance with HIPAA (US), GDPR (EU), and other regional healthcare data protection laws.

### **🔗 How do I connect my existing healthcare data?**
You can upload medical records manually through our secure dashboard, or request exports from your current healthcare providers. We support common formats like PDF, HL7 FHIR, and DICOM imaging files.

### **⏰ How long does it take to set up?**
- **Account Creation**: 2-3 minutes
- **Wallet Connection**: 1-2 minutes with HashPack
- **First Health Record Upload**: 5-10 minutes
- **Complete Setup**: Under 15 minutes for basic usage

### **👨‍⚕️ I'm a healthcare provider - how do I get started?**
Healthcare providers can register as "Doctor" or "Organization" during account creation. You'll need to connect a HashPack wallet and can immediately start requesting consent from patients.

### **🧪 Is this ready for production use?**
The platform is currently in active development. While core features are functional, we recommend it for research, development, and pilot programs rather than mission-critical healthcare operations.

### **🔧 What are the technical requirements?**
- **Browser**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Internet**: Stable internet connection for blockchain operations
- **Wallet**: HashPack wallet for Hedera blockchain integration
- **No special hardware** required - runs on standard computers and mobile devices

### **📊 How do I track who accessed my data?**
Every access is logged on the Hedera blockchain with immutable audit trails. You can view detailed access logs in your dashboard, including who accessed what data, when, and for what purpose.

### **🔐 Can I revoke access at any time?**
Yes! You have complete control. Revoke consent with a single click, which burns the NFT token and immediately prevents further access. The provider receives instant notification.

### **🤝 How do I share data with family members?**
You can grant specific permissions to family members or caregivers through the consent management system. Each person gets their own access level and audit trail.

### **💾 Where is my data actually stored?**
Your data is encrypted and stored across multiple locations:
- **Local encryption** before leaving your device
- **IPFS** for decentralized storage
- **Arweave** for permanent archival
- **Blockchain** for access permissions and audit trails

### **🛡️ What if I lose access to my wallet?**
You can recover access through HashPack's recovery options. For critical medical data, we recommend setting up multiple recovery methods and emergency contacts in your HashPack wallet.

### **⚕️ Can I use this with my existing doctor?**
Yes! Patients can invite any healthcare provider to use the platform. Doctors simply need to create an account and connect their HashPack wallet to start receiving consent requests.

### **📈 How does this improve healthcare outcomes?**
- **Faster diagnosis** through AI assistance and complete medical history access
- **Reduced errors** from missing or incomplete medical information
- **Better coordination** between healthcare providers with shared access
- **Patient empowerment** through complete data control and transparency

3. The provider can access only the data you specified
4. All access is logged on the blockchain for transparency
5. You can revoke consent anytime, burning the NFT

### **🌐 Is my data shared internationally?**
Only with your explicit consent and only for the purposes you approve. We comply with international data transfer regulations and give you complete control over where and how your data is used.

### **💡 What makes this different from other health apps?**

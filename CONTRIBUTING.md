## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

#### **TypeScript & React**
- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow **React 18** best practices and hooks patterns
- Implement **proper error boundaries** for healthcare-critical components
- Use **functional components** with hooks instead of class components

#### **Security First**
- **Never commit sensitive data** (API keys, medical data, credentials)
- **Validate all inputs** and sanitize outputs
- **Use environment variables** for configuration
- **Follow OWASP guidelines** for secure coding
- **Implement proper authentication** and authorization checks

#### **Healthcare Compliance**
- Ensure **HIPAA compliance** for any data handling
- Maintain **audit trails** for all medical data access
- Use **de-identified data** for testing and development
- Follow **HL7 FHIR standards** for healthcare interoperability

### Testing Requirements

#### **Unit Tests**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test-file.test.tsx
```

#### **Test Coverage**
- **Minimum 80% coverage** for new code
- **100% coverage** for critical healthcare features
- **Integration tests** for blockchain operations
- **End-to-end tests** for user workflows

#### **Testing Data**
- Use **mock data** that doesn't contain real medical information
- **Anonymize** any test data thoroughly
- **Separate test data** from production data
- **Clean up test data** after test execution

### Documentation

#### **Code Documentation**
- **Add JSDoc comments** for all public functions
- **Document props** for React components
- **Explain complex algorithms** and business logic

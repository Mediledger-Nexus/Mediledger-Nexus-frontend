## **1:00 - System Overview (2 minutes)**

**Narrator Script:**
"MediLedger Nexus revolutionizes healthcare privacy by using Hedera Hashgraph's enterprise-grade blockchain technology. Here's how it works:

**Key Features:**
1. **NFT-Based Consent**: Each consent is a unique NFT minted to the doctor's wallet
2. **Blockchain Audit Trail**: All actions logged to Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)
3. **Wallet Integration**: HashPack wallet for secure authentication
4. **Role-Based Access**: Separate dashboards for doctors and patients
5. **Real-time Verification**: Smart contracts verify consent validity

**Security Highlights:**
- Patient data never stored on-chain
- Encrypted medical records with blockchain access control
- Immutable audit logs for compliance
- Emergency access protocols

The system ensures patients have complete control over their medical data while providing doctors with verified access."

## **10:00 - NFT Consent System Demo (4 minutes)**

**Narrator Script:**
"This is where the magic happens! Let's demonstrate the NFT-based consent system.

**How NFT Consent Works:**
1. **Doctor Requests Access**: Doctor sends consent request to patient
2. **Patient Reviews & Signs**: Patient reviews permissions and signs with wallet
3. **NFT Minting**: System mints unique NFT to doctor's wallet
4. **Access Verification**: Doctor uses NFT to verify consent for record access
5. **Automatic Expiration**: NFTs expire based on patient-defined time limits

**Demo Scenario:**
- Doctor requests access to patient's cardiology records
- Patient grants consent with 30-day expiration
- NFT minted and transferred to doctor's wallet
- Doctor accesses patient records using NFT verification
- Patient revokes consent - NFT automatically burned

**Blockchain Integration:**
- NFT metadata includes: consent ID, record type, expiration date
- All actions logged to Hedera Consensus Service
- Immutable audit trail for compliance

**Visual Demo:**
- Show doctor sending consent request
- Patient granting consent with signature
- HashPack showing new NFT in doctor's wallet
- Doctor accessing patient records
- HCS logs showing transaction history"
